> I am actively seeking a Research Assistant position and am available to start work full-time after May. Feel free to contact me if you condsider my experience aligns well with your requirements.

I am an undergraduate researcher currently studying at UC Berkeley through the [Berkeley International Study Program](https://bisp.berkeley.edu/). My research interests are twofold: 1) Utilizing computational methods to expand the frontier of social science research, and 2) Exploring the interaction between technology and society, including how they mutually construct each other. Presently, my focus is whether Large Language Models (LLMs) adhere to their own social principles and understanding the relationship between human and machine social principles.

Prior to study in UC Berkeley, I majored in Sociology at National Taiwan University while served as a research assistant at [Academia Sinica, Taiwan](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en/). There, I was part of a Big Data research group, working under the guidance of [Yang-Chih Fu](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=KZvMphwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Hsuan-Wei Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/hsuanweilee/home).

I received a scholarship from the [Y.L. Taiwan Education Foundation](https://yllproject.ntu.edu.tw/) and the [Study Abroad Programme for Future Scholars](https://www.youconf.cc/sites/90819711058413687015/seminar.html), hosted by the Taiwan Ministry of Education, for which I am grateful. Their support enabled me to study at UC Berkeley.

- **Reproducing Classic Models in Social Science: Antisocial Behavior and the Marriage Market** 
    - In recent decades, the social sciences, have seen many classic quantitative models [lose their "replicability"](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aac4716?casa_token=B_cTVEflBYUAAAAA%3A1WzhWM2Feu2ReoTnYNO0tOEM66LmGmxzMB8mIqBFTqtodzQ4fUUowRA5Td5sPIi1fgfSGwF01XKy) due to time and the absence of accessible programs or clear algorithms from original researchers. Our aim is to verify, reproduce, and expand upon these classic sociological models. We hope to either restore or optimize these studies from the historical literature, allowing these significant achievements to be reintroduced to the world. Furthermore, we seek to understand why certain studies cannot be replicated, shedding light on the evolving nature of sociological research and methodology.

- **The Influence of Support Networks Inside and Outside College on Life Satisfaction:** 
    - In 2020, [three consecutive student suicide](https://news.pts.org.tw/article/500144) incidents at NTU ignited widespread discussion and sorrow. My sociology peers and I conducted the National Taiwan University Student Life Survey to explore how future tragedies might be prevented. We discovered that support networks were vital; however, their significant impact on life satisfaction was only felt when those capable of providing emotional support or academic assistance were present on campus.

- **Fire Evacuation Map for Blind People:**
    - According to Taiwanese law, public spaces must provide a fire evacuation map, but these are typically designed for sighted individuals, not for the blind.
    - We have created a universal map that is "readable" for both blind and sighted people.
    - By combining quantitative and qualitative methods, we aim to understand the problems of current tactile maps and determine which textures, icons, line formations, and arrows are most easily distinguishable by individuals with visual impairments.
    - The study results foster the promotion of the birth of Document No. 1120501764, which stipulates that public places must be equipped with universal fire escape evacuation maps.

- **Using a Multi-Level Model to Analyze the Effects of School-Level and Individual-Level Factors on Students' Academic Performance**
    - In this work we analysis the Scottish School Leavers Survey (SSLS). SSLS is a representative survey conducted among young people.
    - We using multi-level model to examine the school-level and individual level factors.

- **How Is Teaching Leadership Possible? A Case Study of National Taiwan University's Leadership Program**
    - Utilizing participant observation and interviews within National Taiwan University's leadership program, this study examines the intricate aspects of leadership education, emphasizing soft skills and leadership's four dimensions. The findings highlight the pivotal role of the program's hidden curriculum‚Äîparticularly through peer and teacher-student interactions‚Äîin significantly enhancing students' leadership capabilities, as evidenced by the adoption of cultural tools and three main teaching methods.

Originally from Taiwan, I cherish the island's natural beauty and am convinced that we offer the [üßãBEST BOBA TEA](https://hackmd.io/E8eGG5XWTm26j6_nmUjaKQ?view) in the world. Before becoming a researcher, I was a journalist, where I reported on wildlife public policy, specifically about the [Formosan rock-monkey](https://e-info.org.tw/search/google/%E5%8A%89%E7%BE%BD%E8%8A%AF#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=%E5%8A%89%E7%BE%BD%E8%8A%AF).


**Fun Fact:**
I am left-handed but play badmintonüè∏ with my right hand.

**A question I thinking recently:**
If machines lack consciousness, how can we argue that humans possess it?
