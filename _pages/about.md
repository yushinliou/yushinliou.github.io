I used to be a journalist, where I reported on wildlife public policy, specifically about the [Formosan rock-monkey](https://e-info.org.tw/search/google/%E5%8A%89%E7%BE%BD%E8%8A%AF#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=%E5%8A%89%E7%BE%BD%E8%8A%AF).


**Fun Fact:**
I am left-handed but play badmintonüè∏ with my right hand.

**A question I thinking recently:**
