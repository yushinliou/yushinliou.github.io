Originally from Taiwan, I cherish the island's natural beauty and am convinced that we offer the [üßãBEST BOBA TEA](https://hackmd.io/E8eGG5XWTm26j6_nmUjaKQ?view) in the world. Before a researcher, I used to be a journalism, where I reported on wildlife public policy, specifically the [Formosan rock-monkey issue](https://e-info.org.tw/search/google/%E5%8A%89%E7%BE%BD%E8%8A%AF#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=%E5%8A%89%E7%BE%BD%E8%8A%AF).

**Fun Fact:**
I am left-handed but play badmintonüè∏ with my right hand.

**A question I thinking recently:**
