### 1. **Brief Summary**
This project examines how social media dynamics, particularly popularity and tightly-knit social circles, influence opportunities for forming new connections. By analyzing triadic closure using survival analysis on Facebook interaction data, it challenges the traditional notion that popularity and close social circles are purely advantageous, revealing their constraining effects.



### 2. **Context**
- **Conducted at**: National Taiwan University
- **Supervisor**: Prof. Hsuan-Wei Lee
- **Project Type**: B.S. thesis and research project
- **Outcome**: Paper under review at *Social Networks*
- **Motivation**: To explore the potential drawbacks of popularity and close social circles on social media in limiting new connections.



### 3. **Target Problem**
Previous studies celebrate popularity and close social circles for providing social support and power. However, this project investigates:
- Whether these advantages limit users' ability to form new ties.
- How factors like local clustering coefficients (LCC) and actor popularity interact to influence network expansion through triadic closure.



### 4. **Method**
#### 4.1 **Hypotheses**
1. **Ego’s Sparse Network (Low LCC)**:
   - Increases likelihood of triadic closure with degree-2 alters who also have sparse networks.
2. **Ego’s Dense Network (High LCC)**:
   - Reduces triadic closure with degree-1 alters due to restricted outreach.
3. **Popularity Effects**:
   - Popular degree-2 alters attract connections, but ego’s high LCC weakens this effect.
   - Similar effects are observed with degree-1 alters.

#### 4.2 **Data Collection**
- **Participants**: 919 college graduates from Taiwan (Class of 2016).
- **Data Sources**:
  - Facebook interaction records over 668 days (freshman to junior years).
  - Surveys capturing demographics, personality traits, and offline interactions.
- **Triad Sampling**:
  - 21,900 triads were extracted for analysis based on interaction data.

#### 4.3 **Analysis Framework**
- **Survival Analysis**:
  - Unit of analysis: triad.
  - Dependent Variable: Time to triadic closure or end of observation period.
  - Independent Variables: LCC, popularity, and interaction terms.
  - Control Variables: Gender, extroversion, and shared neighbors.
- **Revised Hypotheses**:
  - Refined after analyzing results, aligning with nuanced findings on LCC and popularity dynamics.



### 5. **Results**
#### 5.1 **Findings**
1. **Sparse Networks Encourage New Connections**:
   - Ego’s low LCC fosters triadic closure with degree-2 alters, especially those with sparse networks.
   - Changes are most pronounced in groups with the lowest ego LCC.
2. **Popularity Dynamics**:
   - Popular degree-2 alters are more likely to form ties, but ego’s dense network reduces this effect.
   - For degree-1 alters, ego’s high LCC limits new connections to already popular actors.
3. **Tightly-Knit Networks**:
   - Ego’s high LCC prevents degree-1 alters from connecting with new degree-1 alters, reinforcing network constraints.

#### 5.2 **Implications**
- **Network Expansion**:
  - Sparse networks are beneficial for expanding ties, challenging traditional views of popularity and close social circles as universally advantageous.
- **Social Media Design**:
  - Platforms could encourage sparse-network users to foster broader connections, balancing community dynamics.



This study highlights the complexities of social media relationships, demonstrating that network density and popularity are double-edged swords, shaping both opportunities and constraints for new social ties.
