The problem I want to solve is:


> How can we enable elder to maintain their spiritual practice and community connections despite their
physical limitations?


### 1. **Context**

Visiting temples to burn incense and pay respects to ancestors is an integral part of daily life for many elderly people in Taiwan. However, as they age and their physical conditions decline, many are unable to visit temples and perform worship. This not only results in a loss of spiritual support but, more importantly, diminishes their connection to the local community—a vital source of social and emotional support.

- **Conducted at**: National Taiwan University
- **Supervisor**: Prof. Cheng-Yuan Ho
- **Responsibility**: Team works (2 members), the author focused on web framework and UI design


### 3. **Further Investigation**

Elderly individuals often face barriers in participating in traditional worship practices due to:
- Physical challenges that prevent visits to temples.
- Loss of social connection when participating in rituals virtually.
- Distractions and a lack of focus in the home environment.

These issues reduce engagement and motivation for online worship, necessitating a platform that recreates the immersive and communal aspects of traditional ceremonies.



### 4. **Method**
#### 4.1 **User Research and Problem Identification**
- **Interviews**: Conducted interviews with four elderly participants who attended online ceremonies, revealing three key challenges:
  - **Loss of Social Connection**: Lack of interaction with other participants leads to loneliness.
  - **Environmental Distractions**: Home settings hinder concentration during rituals.
  - **Absence of Physical Presence**: Inability to burn joss paper or incense limits the sense of active participation.

#### 4.2 **Platform Design**
- **Homepage Structure**:
  - Features to join or create ceremony forums.
  - Navigation options for different modes: Pray Mode, Wish Mode, and Burning Joss Paper.
- **Interactive Features**:
  1. **Burning Joss Paper**:
     - Virtual joss paper burning where the fire grows as more users contribute.
     - Promotes a sense of collaboration and shared purpose.
  2. **Pray Board**:
     - Users leave prayers for ancestors and view others’ prayers to mirror traditional temple interactions.
  3. **Read Mode**:
     - Real-time scripture reading with interactive sound wave animations responding to users’ voices.

### 5. **Results**
